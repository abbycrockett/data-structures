# Data Structure Visualizer

Hi! This Python project provides interactive visualizations for common data structures. The four structures are trees, stacks, linked lists, and queues. The application uses Streamlit for the GUI and matplotlib/plotly for visualizations.

# General Thoughts

Since my last project was more design-focused, I wanted to revisit Python & some basic data structures. I mostly just copied the look of my VS Code theme, lol. I was surprised to encounter a lot more CSS issues using Streamlit. Using the browser tools, I was able to override some of Streamlitâ€™s default coloring when I ran my code locally.
