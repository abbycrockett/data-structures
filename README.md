# Data Structure Visualizer

Hi! This Python project is a work in progress. It provides interactive visualizations for common data structures like trees & stacks. The application uses Streamlit for the GUI and matplotlib/plotly for visualizations.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Run the app:
   ```python -m streamlit run main.py```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point for the Streamlit app
- `data_structures/`: Implementations of data structures
- `visualizations/`: Visualization logic

# General Thoughts

Using Streamlit has helped me learn more about CSS. I have been inspecting the elements more frequently to fix some of the style issues. For this project, instead of having a grand design plan lol, I just tried to make it resemble my VS Code theme. My main goal with this project was to refresh some data structure concepts and revisit Python for fun.
