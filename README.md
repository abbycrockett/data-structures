# Data Structure Visualizer

Hi! This Python project is a work in progress. It provides interactive visualizations for common data structures. The application uses Streamlit for the GUI and matplotlib/plotly for visualizations.

## Getting Started

1. Run the app:
   ```python -m streamlit run main.py```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point for the Streamlit app
- `data_structures/`: Implementations of data structures
- `visualizations/`: Visualization logic

# General Thoughts

Since my last project was more design-focused, I wanted to revisit Python & some basic data structures. I mostly just copied the look of my VS Code theme, lol. I was surprised to encounter a lot more CSS issues using Streamlit. Using the browser tools, I was able to override some of Streamlitâ€™s default coloring.
