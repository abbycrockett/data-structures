# Data Structure Visualizer

This Python project is a work in progress. It provides interactive visualizations for common data structures like trees. The application uses Streamlit for the GUI and matplotlib/plotly for visualizations.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```pip install streamlit matplotlib plotly

   ```
2. Run the app:
   ```python -m streamlit run main.py

   ```
